Easily count unqiue views of your posts.

== Description ==

<strong>Posts Unique View Counter</strong> allows you to easily count how many times a post have been uniquely viewed.

Just install the plugin and the counting begins. No coding skills needed.

= How does it work? =
* All views of the post will start at zero (0) upon the plugin installation.
* When a visitor viewed your post, it will save a cookie on the visitor so that same visitor will only count as one (1) view, this way we can uniquely identify each visitor.
* The cookie expires after a month, so if the same person viewed your post after the cookie expires it will count as another view.
* Visitors who use "incognito" or something similar will be counted always as a unique visitor because "incognito" mode does not save cookies.
* One (1) visitor = One (1) cookie.

= Requirements =
* WordPress 4.8.5 or higher.
* PHP 7.2 or higher.
