== Description ==

<strong>Posts Unique View Counter</strong> allows you to easily display how many times a post have been uniquely viewed with this easy to install plugin.

Just install the plugin and the counting begins. No coding skills needed.

<h4>FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li> Displays how many times a post has been viewed on each post. <strong>(See screenshot-1.jpg)</strong></li>
<li> Displays a sortable view count column on <strong>All Posts</strong> page in the WordPress admin. <strong>(See screenshot-2.jpg)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h4>
<ul>
<li> All views of the post will start at zero (0) upon the plugin installation.</li>
<li> When a visitor viewed your post, it will save a cookie on the visitor so that same visitor will only count as one (1) view, this way we can uniquely identify each visitor.</li>
<li> The cookie expires after a month, so if the same person viewed your post after the cookie expires it will count as another view.</li>
<li> Visitors who use "incognito" or something similar will be counted always as a unique visitor because "incognito" mode does not save cookies.</li>
<li> One (1) visitor = One (1) cookie.</li>
</ul>
